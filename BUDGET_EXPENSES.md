The 80:10:10 reward model is a representation of the community-first ideology that Sesameseed embraces. Rewards are distributed as SEED token. Voting for Sesameseed entitles an individual to their proportional share of 80% of node rewards, 10% is allocated for the SEEDGerminator Development Fund, and 10% is allocated for Operating Expenses.
