Sesameseed was founded in March of 2018 in Los Angeles, California. The DPOS landscape was evolving and an opportunity was presented to assemble the community, represented collectively as one voice. Without representation, the voice of the individual can be lost amongst self serving entities in delegated governance. By pooling the collective resources of the community, Sesameseed has brought thousands of people into the dialogue with how blockchain technology has, should, and will continue to grow.

Sesameseed is an elected community representative and block producer with overwhelming support for its community-first ideology. In no way is this ideology more clearly represented than through the 80:10:10 resource sharing model by which SEED token is created and distributed to the community.

* 80% of SEED rewards are distributed to voters proportionally.
* 10% is distributed to the SEEDGerminator Developer Fund to promote development on the blockchain.
* 10% is distributed to Sesameseed for Operating Expenses.
