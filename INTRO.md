**Sesameseed** is a community that exists on multiple blockchains created to support its members and developers by providing fair and transparent representation in delegated governance. Sesameseed reliably distributes daily rewards to its voting community in the form of SEED, an auto-compounding token that is backed by node rewards that are earned from producing blocks on multiple blockchains (TRON, Ontology). The peg is designed to always increase in value and the token is exchangeable for its pegged value at any time.
